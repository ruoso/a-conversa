// ADR 0030 §10 — per-facet vote keying / canonical seven-value
//   `FacetStatus` union + the eight-rule derivation walk.
//
// Client-side mirror of `apps/server/src/projection/facet-status.ts`'s
// `deriveFacetStatus`. The server does not expose a client-callable
// helper, and the WS `proposal-status` broadcast only covers facets
// attached to *pending* proposals — committed / withdrawn / meta-
// disagreement facets need the same state-machine evaluation locally.
// Since `apps/server` is not a workspace dependency of any UI surface
// and `@a-conversa/shared-types` does not re-export `FacetStatus`, this
// file mirrors the small rule set verbatim. If a future refactor extracts
// a shared methodology types package, the duplication becomes the call
// site.
//
// Walks the per-session event log once and builds a per-entity per-facet
// `FacetState` then runs the eight derivation rules to produce the final
// `FacetStatus` per entity-facet pair. Rules ported from
// `deriveFacetStatus` per ADR 0030 §10 +
// `pf_projection_facet_status_refactor`:
//
//   1. Meta-disagreement on a facet short-circuits to 'meta-disagreement'.
//   2. No candidate value yet → 'awaiting-proposal'.
//   3. Filter votes + withdrawals by current participants (joined and not left).
//   4. A withdraw-agreement against a committed facet → 'withdrawn'.
//      (Withdrawals come from `withdraw-agreement` events only — per
//      ADR 0030 §3 the legacy `vote.choice = 'withdraw'` arm is retired;
//      closed by `pf_unit_test_audit`.)
//   5. Any `dispute` vote → 'disputed'.
//   6. Committed (no dispute / withdraw) → 'committed'.
//   7. All current participants voted `agree` → 'agreed'.
//   8. Anything else → 'proposed'.
//
// **`node-created` / `edge-created` populate inline candidates.** Per
// ADR 0030 §4 + §5: a node's `wording` facet enters life with the
// captured text as its candidate (no proposal needed); an edge's
// `shape` facet enters life with the inline carriage. The
// `classification` / `substance` facets enter life with `candidateValue
// === null` and surface as `'awaiting-proposal'` until a proposal lands.
//
// **A new facet-valued proposal clears prior votes on that facet.** Per
// ADR 0030 §7: the prior `perParticipant` map's contents were votes
// against the OLD candidate; the new candidate is a fresh proposal that
// needs fresh agreement.
//
// **`withdraw-agreement` events** are tracked per `(entity, facet,
// participant)` per ADR 0030 §3; a withdrawal against a committed
// facet sends it to `'withdrawn'`.
//
// Returns `FacetStatusIndex`: two `Map`s — one per entity kind (nodes / edges)
// — keyed by entity id, each value a `Partial<Record<FacetName, FacetStatus>>`.
// An entity with no facet-targeting events appears as an empty record (or
// no entry at all — consumers should treat both the same via
// `index.nodes.get(id) ?? EMPTY_FACET_STATUSES`).
